Top strategies for success include dedicating 10-12 hours daily to study, mastering current affairs, and practicing answer writing. Take inspiration from Kanishk Kataria (AIR 1, 2018), who balanced a demanding IT role in Bangalore with consistent mock tests. If you're transitioning from corporate life, look for institutes offering correspondence courses or online modules to ease the shift.
